# US_Honey_CaseStudy

Honey Production Analysis
Project Overview

This project aims to analyze honey production data across different states in the US over a period of several years. The dataset contains information about the number of colonies, yield per colony, total production, stocks, average price, value of production, and the year.

Data Exploration and Cleaning

The dataset was loaded and inspected for missing values and inconsistencies.
The unnecessary 'Unnamed: 0' column was dropped.
The dataset was checked for duplicate entries.
Data Analysis

State Participation:

The number of years each state participated in honey production was analyzed.
A pie chart was created to visualize the distribution of state participation.
Top Honey Producing States:

The total honey production for each state was calculated and ranked.
A bar chart was created to visualize the top 5 honey-producing states.
Change in Average Honey Price:

The average price of honey was calculated for each year.
A line plot was created to visualize the trend in average honey price over time.
Year with Highest Honey Production:

The total honey production for each year was calculated and ranked.
A bar chart was created to visualize the year with the highest production.
State with Highest Production in 2000:

The dataset was filtered to include only entries for the year 2000.
The states were ranked based on their honey production in 2000.
A bar chart was created to visualize the top-producing state in 2000.
States with the Highest Number of Colonies in 2000:

The dataset was filtered to include only entries for the year 2000.
The states were ranked based on the number of colonies in 2000.
A bar chart was created to visualize the states with the highest number of colonies in 2000.
